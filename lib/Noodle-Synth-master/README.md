## Compatibility
This library should work for the following boards:
* **Please note that polyphony depends on your microcontroller's processor speed.**
* The stable polyphony means that the board can handle playing the corresponding amount of notes at the same time without any issues/lag.  [To change the stable polyphony, go here](https://github.com/nathanRamaNoodles/MusicWithoutDelay-LIbrary#how-to-change-polyphony).

| Board  |                         Stable Polyphony |Max Polyphony(Might be unstable) | Pin(CHA) | Pin(CHB) | [Stereo Support](https://github.com/nathanRamaNoodles/MusicWithoutDelay-LIbrary#new-stereo-support) |
| :----------------------------------------------------  |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| :-:|
| Arduino Uno, Nano, Pro Mini (boards with atmega328p)  |4| 8 | 11 | 3 |yes|
| Arduino Micro, Pro Micro (boards with atmega32u4)     |4| 8 | 6 | N/A |no|
| Arduino MEGA-2560                                     |10|16~18 | 10| 9 |yes|
| Teensy 2.0                                            |4| 8 | A9 | N/A |no|
| Teensy LC, 3.0+ (the Teensy 3rd generation)           |16| 30* | 3 | 4| YES!!! (you can output on more than 2 pins)|
| ESP8266 (under construction)                          |2| ~8 | RX line(uses i2s) | N/A | No!!! ðŸ˜¡|

### (NEW) You can change the Teensy's output pin (3rd generation only).  
* To change, simply call your pin number in the `begin` method.  **But the pin must be PWM.**  For example:
 ```
 begin(6,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0)  //output on pin 6
 //or
 begin(A9,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0)  //output on pin A9
 ```

### How to Change Polyphony
* For example: The Teensy (3rd generation) is a very powerful chip; however, I had to save some **SRAM** so I made the max number of voices = 16.  If you want to change it, simply go to source code in [src/synth.cpp](https://github.com/nathanRamaNoodles/MusicWithoutDelay-LIbrary/blob/master/src/synth.cpp) and change the maxVoice settings at **Line 9**.  You can do this for other boards.
```
...
#elif defined(__arm__) && defined(TEENSYDUINO)
#define maxVOICES 16 //Teensy 3.++; Teensy boards can handle a whooping 30+ simultaneous voices(Teensy is a powerful 32-bit chip)
...
```

## Updates
* This library has been upgraded to version 3.5.1
  * previous versions [found here](https://github.com/nathanRamaNoodles/MusicWithoutDelay-LIbrary/releases).
* Improvements
	* Added videos to demonstration
  * Created an anti-clip algorithm that adjusts the Volume to avoid static noise :)
  * more to come...

## Demonstration

* v1.0.0 demo
  * Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/uoHhlrqZYDI) for a Legend of Zelda music demonstration.  In the video, an Arduino Nano outputs two voices. The Arduino uses a vibrating motor as a percussion instrument, and an RGB LED to add some fire to the show.  The delay function is not used at all :)

## Advantages
* This Arduino Library makes an Arduino board play music in the background while running your program(Assuming your code doesn't have any delay).  
  * **So you can view the Serial Monitor, display stuff on an OLED, and read buttons while this library plays your music in the background**
  * This library doesn't use the delay function; it uses a similar technique to [Arduino's BlinkWithoutDelay sketch](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay).
* You do not need any shield or extra hardware for this library.
* **You can play unlimited number of notes at the same time**
* Modulation effects added
* **Volume Control**
	* Anti-clipping algorithm prevents static noise
* **Stereo Support**
* Pause/resume Song
* Play song forward and backwards!! :D
* `skipTo()` a favorite part in the song(The hardest to program, but it was worth it)
* **Sustain Override** for notes. **Note: you must call `overrideSustain`** otherwise instrument will choose automatically.
  * Default is `SUSTAIN`
  * Reverse effect `REV_SUSTAIN`
  * Slur effect `NONE`

## Disadvantages(Soon to be fixed)
* ~~Can't play more than two notes on many arduino boards.~~ ðŸ”«
* ~~Tone library creates timer conflicts with Servo library~~ðŸ”«
* ~~I am trying to move away from the Tone library because many common libraries hate it.~~ ðŸ”« :D
* ~~Not working on Arduino Mega 2560.~~ ðŸ”«
* ~~No volume control, yet~~.  ðŸ”«
* Very unstable on ESP8266. ðŸ˜¡

## Quick Start
In this example, we will use an Arduino Uno.

1. Install this library by downloading the zip folder.  Read [this Arduino Library Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) to install the library.
2. Open the examples folder after installing the library.  
3. Choose the "Basics" sketch.
4. Attach a speaker as per the schematic below.
	* **Note: Your pin will be different depending on the [compatibility table](https://github.com/nathanRamaNoodles/MusicWithoutDelay-LIbrary#compatibility)**
5. Upload the code.
6. The comments in the code should be helpful.  And try the other examples included with this library.

# How to write Music

You may be wondering how one can write songs for the Arduino without any knowledge of Music!  Its actually quite interesting and fun.  First you need to know the value of the notes in Music.
![alt text](http://ezstrummer.com/ezriffs/demo/notes_rests.gif "Note Values")

Triplets= 1/3

Now, remember these values.
You will need them in the next step.

## The Arduino Code

Now that you know the values of the basic notes in music, let's make some noise!
The Music file is stored in the `PROGMEM`.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanRamaNoodles/MusicWithoutDelay-LIbrary/master/char%20song.PNG "storage Variable")

### Format(RTTL or Ring Tone Transfer Language)
`const char song[] PROGMEM =  " name of song : settings : notes";`
#### Name(Optional)

* The name of the Song can be set before the first semicolon.

#### The Settings(Optional)

* The settings for the song are set in-between the first and second semicolon(You may use a comma or white space between each setting option)
  * `d`= The default duration. So any note(letter) without a number in front will automatically be assigned with the default duration
    * By default, `d=1` which is a wholenote
  * `o`= The default Octave.
    * By default, `o=4` which is middle C on the Piano
  * `b`= the BPM(Beat per Minute) or the Tempo of the Song
    * By default, `b=100`, which is normal tempo in music
  * `s`= The sharps
    * Ex: `s=aeb`, means all a's, e's, and b's in the song are sharps
  * `f`= The Flats
    * Ex: `f=aeb`, means all a's, e's, and b's in the song are flats

#### Notes(Required)

* The song's notes are made after the second semicolon.
  * there are only 7 possible letters. `a,b,c,d,e,f,g`
  * A rest uses the letter `p`
* the duration of each note is made before the letter
  * ex: `4f` is a quarter note
* put a period `.` for dotted notes
  * ex: `2.f` is a dotted half note
* The duration can be determined by this formula.
  * **Formula: 4/(note value)= duration.  So an eight note would be 4/(1/2) = 8.**
* To name a letter a flat put an underscore `_` right after the letter
  * ex: `b_`
* To name a letter a sharp put a hashtag `#` right after the letter
  * ex: `c#`
* To raise a note up an octave, put the number of octaves to be raised after the Sharp/Flats/Letter
  * ex: `b1`
  * ex2: `c#1`
* To drop a note down an Octave, put a minus `-` sign and then the number of octaves to be dropped after the Sharp/Flats/Letter
  * ex: `b-1`
  * ex: `c#-2`
* Put a comma `,` to indicate the next note
  * ex: `b,c`  means that the notes will be played one after the other(taking a breath)
* Put a plus `+` sign to indicate the next note is a slur with the current note
  * ex: `b+c`  means that the notes will be played like a slur in music(without taking a breath)

So using these format rules, we can make this ordered outline for the definition of a Note.
1. duration   (optional)

2. period     (optional)

3. letter     **(required)**

4. sharp/flat (optional)

5. octave     (optional)

6. `,` or `+` **(required)**    

Let's use some examples to understand the format of the song file.  

## Examples
Assume `const char name[] PROGMEM`

1. Question: Lets try to play the letter C    
   * Answer:  `name = "::c";`

2. Question: Play the C major scale with wholenotes  
   * Answer:  `name = "::c,d,e,f,g,a,b,c1";`

3. Question: Play the C major scale with sixteenth notes
   * Answer:  `name = ":d=16:c,d,e,f,g,a,b,c1";`

4. Question: Play the C Major with different durations
   * Answer:  `name = "::c,4d,2e,16f,g,8a,32b,c1";`

5. Question: Play the C Major faster
   * Answer:  `name = ":b=160:c,d,e,f,g,a,b,c1";`

6. Question: Play some dotted quarter notes
   * Answer:  `name = "::4.c,8.d,2.e";`

7. Question: play a note every second
   * Answer:  `name = ":d=4,b=60:c,p";`  //bpm=60 means a quarter note = 1 second

8. Question: Slur every three notes
   * Answer:  `name = "::a+b+c,c+d+e";`

9. Question: Combine note with all possible options
   * Answer:  `name = "::4.a_-1";`

10. Question: Play notes with whitespaces(whitespaces make it easier to write music since it's easier on the eyes)
    * Answer:  `name = ":: 12c , 12b , 12a , 4a , 4b , 4c , 2g , 2a , d";`  //The library is user-friendly, it ignores spaces **(but don't put spaces in between the definitions of the notes)** So don't do this `":: 12 c # ,"`.

# Creating a MusicWithoutDelay Object

You may create a MusicWithoutDelay object two different ways:

```
MusicWithoutDelay buzzer(const char *song); // where song is a const char song[] PROGMEM
```
or
```
MusicWithoutDelay buzzer;
```

# Starting the speaker
In order to start our speaker, we need to call the `begin()` function.
You can call it two ways.
```
begin(int pin, int waveForm, int envelope, int mod)
```  
Where **pin** is the pin connected to the speaker.  It must be `CHA` or `CHB`.  For example: **CHA is pin 11** on UNO, and **CHB is pin 3** on UNO.  

The **waveForm** can be `SINE`, `SQUARE`, `TRIANGLE`, `SAW`, `RAMP`, or `NOISE`
* `TRIANGLE` is recommended

The **envelope** can be `ENVELOPE0`, `ENVELOPE1`,`ENVELOPE2`, or `ENVELOPE3`.
* Default is `ENVELOPE0`


The **mod** can be any positive or negative number to create fancy musical effects.  **The further away you are from `0`, the fancier the song will sound.**
* Default is `0`.

```
begin(int waveForm, int envelope, int mod)
```
Use this format for more than one instrument.

# âœ¨Simple Continuous Frequency

If you don't want to play a song but want to play a simple continuous sine wave, all you have to do is call:
```
buzzer.setFrequency(440.0); // A4 is 440 hz
```
**However, if you don't know the frequency for a note, just call:**
```
float freq = buzzer.getNoteAsFrequency(int Note);
```
Where `Note` can be referenced by simply typing `NOTE_A4` for A4, or `NOTE_C4` for middle C.

# âœ¨(New) Volume Control

It's been forever, but I finally mastered the art of Timers, and with it I figured out how to control Volume.

Fortunately, setting the volume is a piece of Cake:
```
buzzer.setVolume(50);// 0-127
```
The **min volume is 0** and the **max is 127**.

# âœ¨(New) Sustain Override
So, you know how a piano's volume decreases overtime as soon as you play a note?  Well, I've applied the same principle to my library. As a bonus, I've also figured out how to make music sound like it's being played backwards!

As you know, your RTTL files contains commas `,` and plus `+` signs to seperate notes from each other; my library automatically adds sustain and removes it as your song plays.  **However, if you want the whole song to sound "backwards", you must Override the instrument!**

## How to Override Instruments:
```
buzzer.overrideSustain(true);
```
## Change Sustain type
After you have overridden the instrument, you now have the ability to choose a sustain effect.  If you choose to revert back to the original sustain, simply call `buzzer.overrideSustain(false);`
```
buzzer.setSustain(NONE);        // monotone sound
buzzer.setSustain(SUSTAIN);     // Normal sustain
buzzer.setSustain(REV_SUSTAIN); // Backwards effect
```

# âœ¨(New) Stereo Support
For the boards that have stereo support, all you have to do to set the instruments to different pins.  For instance, this will allow sound to come at two pins:

```
buzzer.begin(CHA,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);
buzzer2.begin(CHB,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);
```


You can even combine buzzers on the same output:
```
buzzer.begin(CHA,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);  //Two Sine waves on both pins
buzzer2.begin(CHA,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);
buzzer3.begin(CHB,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);
buzzer4.begin(CHB,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);
```

## Teensy's Multi-Stereo
The Teensy(3rd generation) is really powerful; you can output on any PWM pin with **barely** any limitations.

For instance:
```
buzzer.begin(CHA,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);   //CHA is also pin 3
buzzer2.begin(CHB,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);  //CHB is pin 4
buzzer3.begin(6,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);    //pin 6
buzzer4.begin(A9,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);   //pin A9
buzzer5.begin(6,SINE,ENVELOPE0,0);    //pin 6...again :D
etc...
```
